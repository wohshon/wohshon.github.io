Just a online journal to document stuffs I do day to day (most of which can be found on my [github](https://github.com/wohshon) ) as I have a tendency to forget things. Will try to add in some bits and pieces of aspects of my day to day life as well (food, random thoughts etc)

Oh, and I don't expect this blog to be frequently updated :)

Site is based on this wonderful jekyll themed blog from Dirk: [https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)
