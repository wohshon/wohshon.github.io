A journal to document stuffs I do day to day (most of which can be found on my [github](https://github.com/wohshon) ) as I have a tendency to forget things. 

I ~~work for Red Hat~~ have since joined another company and articles here are all done in my personal capacity and does not represent the Company.
Will try to add in some bits and pieces of aspects of my day to day life as well (food, random thoughts etc)


Site is based on this wonderful jekyll themed blog from Dirk: [https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)
